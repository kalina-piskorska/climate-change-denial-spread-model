### climate-change-denial-spread-model
Code used for a computational model simulating climate change beliefs spread

## Overview
This NetLogo model simulates the spread of climate change beliefs within a population of individuals. Each believer has an initial belief level, which changes over time due to interactions with other individuals and exposure to media. The aim of the model is to identify possible methods for reducing climate change denial.

## Model components
- Individuals (believers): Each agent in the model represents a person with a climate change belief.
- Social Influence: Believers are connected in a network where they can influence each other.
- Media Influence: Believers can be affected by pro-climate and denialist media, depending on their susceptibility.
- Parameters: Users can adjust variables such as initial belief distribution, trust, media influence, and social factors.

## Model initialization
To initialize, use the setup function ("setup" button):
- Clears the environment and resets ticks (rounds).
- Spawns a number of believers at random locations.
- Assigns each believer an initial belief level and accordingly, a color (from red to green).

## Belief spread simulation process
# Social Influence
- Each believer connects with a set number of nearby individuals.
- Links are colored pink if their beliefs are similar enough for mutual influence, otherwise gray.
- Influence from neighbors is averaged and, after being modified by the general trust in others, applied to each believerâ€™s state.

# Media Influence
- There are two typed of media incorporated in the model: denialist - with no belief in climate change - and pro-climate media, with a full belief in climate change.
- Media influence is weighted by general population trust and individual susceptibility, based on the similarity between beliefs (e.g., an individual with a low belief can be more likely to be influenced by denialist media).

# Updating Beliefs
- Belief state is updated each tick based on influence factors (others, media)
- The color of each believer is updated to reflect belief level.

## User interface
# Buttons
- setup: Initializes the model.
- go: Runs the simulation continuously.
- go once: Advances the model one tick at a time.

# Adjustable parameters
Trust parameters:
- own_belief_confidence: General population weight of an individual's initial belief, one's confidence and stability of the belief.
- trust_denial_media: General population trust in denialist media.
- trust_proclimate_media: General population trust in pro-climate media.

Links parameters:
- distance_links: Spatial radius limiting the creation of possible social connections.
- num_links: Number of possible social connections per believer per tick.

Opinion distance thresholds:
- accept_states_distance_others: Threshold for social influence based on belief similarity.
- accept_states_distance_media: Threshold for media influence based on belief similarity.

Distribution parameters:
- avg_initial_belief: Average initial belief, contributing to the initial distribution of beliefs in the population.
- std_initial_belief: A standard deviation of the initial belief, contributing to the initial distribution of beliefs in the population.
- number_of_people: Size of the population.

# Plots, monitors, graphic window
- Main window showing the visualization of the believers changing beliefs and creating connections with others.
- A plot showing changes in the numbers of believers with different beliefs (colors) through time (ticks).
    - Monitors showing specific numbers of believers with different colors.
- Monitors displaying the population's current average belief (state) and its standard deviation.
